## 🌟 Why I Built Resume Optimizer Bot

In today's highly competitive job market, **first impressions are made through resumes**.  
I observed that:
- Many talented candidates often struggle to get interview calls **not because they lack skills**, but because their resumes **don't align** properly with job descriptions.
- Small missing keywords or unhighlighted achievements can significantly reduce a candidate’s chances.

🚀 This inspired me to create **Resume Optimizer Bot** —  
an **AI-powered assistant** that analyzes resumes instantly and provides actionable feedback, helping users:

- Highlight strengths (Pros)
- Improve weak areas (Cons)
- Increase resume visibility to recruiters

✨ This project allowed me to combine **AI, real-time job data, cloud deployment**, and **frontend/backend development** — not just to practice technical skills but also to **create meaningful career impact**.

> "Your resume is your story. I built this bot to help you tell it better."
